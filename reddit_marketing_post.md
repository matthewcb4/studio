### Option 3: The "Tonal-Style" Value Proposition
**Title:** I built an AI-powered workout app that adapts to your home gym equipment.

**Body:**
Hi Reddit,

I’m excited to share **fRepo**, a new fitness application designed to bring the intelligence of smart home gyms to your phone, without the hardware cost.

**The Problem:** Most workout apps are either clear-cut logs (requiring you to plan everything) or rigid video classes (requiring specific gear).
**The Solution:** fRepo uses on-device AI to generate custom workout routines based specifically on the equipment you have available right now—whether that’s a full garage gym or just a pair of dumbbells.

**Key Features:**
*   **Dynamic Workout Generation:** AI creates balanced routines tailored to your available gear.
*   **Progressive Overload Tracking:** Automatic logging and history tracking with visual heatmaps.
*   **Privacy-First:** No accounts or cloud sync required to get started.
*   **Premium Experience:** Clean, ad-free interface designed for focus.

It is available now on the Google Play Store as a one-time purchase ($0.99). No subscriptions.

I would appreciate any feedback on the UX and workout generation logic. Thank you!

### Option 4: The Clean Launch Announcement
**Title:** Launching fRepo: A premium, subscription-free AI fitness coach for Android.

**Body:**
I am proud to announce the release of **fRepo** on the Google Play Store.

fRepo was built to solve a simple problem: effective, personalized training should be accessible and affordable. We’ve replaced effective but expensive human coaching with an adaptive AI that understands your equipment limitations and fitness goals.

**Why fRepo?**
1.  **Zero Subscriptions:** A single $0.99 purchase grants lifetime access.
2.  **Smart Adaptation:** We don't just give you a list of exercises; we build a workout around what you own.
3.  **Data Visualization:** Visual consistency trackers help keep you accountable.

## 👟 Casual & Indie (Original Drafts)
*Best for: r/AndroidApps, r/homegym, r/SideProject*

### Option 1: The "Anti-Subscription" Angle
**Title:** I got tired of paying $30/month for fitness apps, so I built an AI coach for $0.99. No subs, ever.

**Body:**
Hey everyone,

I've been working on a fitness app called **fRepo** (Fitness Repo) because I was frustrated with the current state of workout apps. Everything seems to be a subscription nowadays, and half the time I just want a good workout based on the equipment I actually have in my garage/apartment.

So I built my own.

**What it does:**
*   **AI Workouts:** It generates workouts specifically for the equipment you select. Have only dumbbells and a bench? It knows.
*   **Real Tracking:** Heatmaps (GitHub style) to track your consistency.
*   **Privacy:** No account required to start, no selling your data.
*   **Cost:** $0.99 one-time. That's it. It's cheaper than a protein bar.

I'm an indie dev just looking for some honest feedback.

### Option 2: The "Technical/Indie Dev" Angle
**Title:** I turned my Next.js PWA into a TWA on the Play Store. Here is the result.

**Body:**
I've spent the last few months building a fitness tracker using Next.js, Firebase, and AI. Instead of rewriting it native, I packaged it as a Trusted Web Activity (TWA) for Android.

It's called **fRepo**. It uses on-device preferences and AI to generate custom workouts based on available equipment.

**Tech Stack:**
*   Next.js 16 (PWA)
*   Firebase (Auth/Firestore)
*   AI for workout generation
*   Tailwind/Shadcn UI

I'd love for you guys to test the performance and responsiveness. It's $0.99 (no subscriptions).
